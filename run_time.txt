Answers to questions:

1. The run time of the program using a for loop is much greater than the
one of elementwise multiplication. Furthermore, it increases at a much 
greater rate.

2. As the value of N increases ten fold the runtime tends to increase 
exponentially, achieving way greater numbers with each increase of N. 
Especially when the values of N become very large.
